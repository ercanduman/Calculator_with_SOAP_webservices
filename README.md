# Calculator package with SOAP webservices

This is a workaround (**WA**) type project that can execute SOAP web services and do calculations from web service.

There is a table (`eduman.calculations`) with columns of _NumberA, NumberB, Operand,_ and _Result_. The main purpose with this project is handling the numbers in eduman.calculations table and doing calculation with calling web service.

There is a nice website which provides SOAP services for doing simple calculations such as:  Add (+), Subtract (-), Multiply (*) and Divide (/);
